Welcome to Exxo Avalon: Origins! Avalon is a vanilla-oriented mod, expanding on content while keeping to a generally vanilla feel. As of now, there are:
- Over 1200 items
- Over 100 NPCs, including 7 bosses and 2 town NPCs (plans for more eventually)
- Several new structures, including Ice Shrines, the Evil Shrine, the Temple of the Observer, the Hellcastle, and the Sky Fortress
- A new world evil, the Contagion, which is an alternate to the Corruption and Crimson
- Plans for the Tropics, an alternate to the Jungle, which will be complete with alternates to everything the Jungle has to offer
- Superhardmode, which is currently unfinished, and is after Hardmode - activated after killing the Wall of Steel, it will increase enemy health, damage, and defense, as well as add several new enemies to the spawnpool
- Plans for a new final boss, fought after the end of Superhardmode, Ultrablivion
- A stamina mechanic, which is completely optional, but allows you to do things such as rocket jumping, teleporting, dashing, sprinting, wall climbing, and swimming without the need for an accessory
- Several new prefixes (including some for armor only)
- Mystical Tomes, which are similar to accessories, but only grant stat boosts
