		Bestiary: {
			BaskingSpewer: In ancient times, a saltwater river once ran through the desert. These powerful creatures evolved to survive in the now dry sand.
			Blaze: This hellish creature is quite vulnerable to water. Thankfully, no water exists in its natural environment, so it thrives.
			ContagionMimic: Sometimes, when a Mimic falls ill, instead of recovering fully, they turn into this monster. They can be birthed from ordinary chests by force.
			ContaminatedGhoul: Ghouls plagued by the Contagion slobber infectious drool that weakens their victim's immune system.
			Cougher: Coughers fly around seeking prey to coat in their poisonous breath. Their breath contains a pathogen able to completely destroy their target's immune system, making it easier for the Contagion to infect.
			EctoHand: They reach out, as if to touch their lost life. Or maybe they just want to give you a high-five?
			Gargoyle: Made of stone, they resemble mythical creatures. They guard the Hellcastle and its treasures.

			HellboundLizard: Similar in appearance to Lihzahrds, they run about in the Hellcastle, seemingly without purpose.
			Ickslime: Gelatinous and icky sentient globs of mucus, Ickslimes break down their prey into material for the contagion to make new monsters.

			BloodshotEye: The bloodiest of eyes, this creature exists in a state of fear. Its veins may rupture at any time.
			BoneFish: This skeleton of a fish pesters anyone who enters the lava in the Underworld. Be careful if you ever need to explore under the lava's surface.
			FallenHero: A hero, fallen into blood. It roams aimlessly on nights of a Blood Moon.
			Pyrasite: Giant flat worms created by the Contagion, these creatures enjoy feeding on pre-eaten food from the stomach of titans and other large lifeforms.
			BacteriumPrime: This giant eye of Contagion never ceases, never truly closes. Those who fall to its gaze will be just as felled by its plague.
			DesertBeak: The guardian of the desert, this large vulture summons its smaller brethren to assist it in battle. It lifts prey up with its talons, then drops them to fall to their doom.
			IrateBones: These Angry Bones have donned a set of armor to further fuel their wrath.
			CursedScepter: Enchanted through the malevolence of the Dungeon, weapons like this cut intruders down to size.

			ContaminatedBunny: Bunnies are pure beings that normally cannot be afflicted by the Contagion, but will succumb under the effects of a Blood Moon.
			Shadlopod: These devious creatures blend themselves into the ebonstone ceilings of the corruption and take pleasure in watching their prey panic when they take their vision away.
			Rafflesia: A horrible, large, rotten-smelling plant that seems to constantly produce flies.
			Fly: Truly-annoying insects that love festering meat and rotten produce. They are as disgusting as they sound.
			AmberSlime: A simple gelatinous creature that somehow also has the properties of amber. It takes a long time to digest anything.
			InfestedAmberSlime: Consistent consumption of the bugs in the Tropics caused these slimes to burst into a multitude of them when killed.
			OreSlime: An ore-filled gelatinous creature that drops whatever ore is contained inside.
			MineralSlime: An ore-filled gelatinous creature that drops whatever ore is contained inside.
			PoisonDartFrog: Highly toxic frogs that have made their home in the tropics. Those that touch their skin are often poisoned to death.
			Mosquito: These nasty insects are known for carrying diseases. They will abscond with your blood, leaving infections where they landed.
			RedArowana: Normally these fish are quite passive, but something in the Tropics causes them to become aggressive. What makes them behave this way is unknown.
			Mime: The Copycat Extraordinaire, the Mime loves to copy what its opponent does. The cruel joke often lands it in lava, though.
			WallOfSteel: An abandoned creation designed to accomplish what the original Guardian of the Underworld could not - prevent the Terrarian from further destabilizing the world.
			MechanicalHungry: The Wall of Steel's many mouths, attached by steel cables. As a last resort, they can detach and precisely chase down threats.
			InfectedPickaxe: Inspirited by the viciously virulent Contagion, this tool swings about attempting to split apart its foes.
			EvilVulture: A vulture tainted by the Corruption, its nature becoming twisted and foul.
			BloodyVulture: A vulture consumed by the Crimson, it similarly seeks to consume its prey.
			SicklyVulture: A vulture afflicted by the Contagion, its cells have been mutated by the rampaging virus.
