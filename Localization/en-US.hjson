		Bestiary: {
			BaskingSpewer: In ancient times, a saltwater river once ran through the desert. These powerful creatures evolved to survive in the now dry sand.
			Blaze: This hellish creature is quite vulnerable to water. Thankfully, no water exists in its natural environment, so it thrives.
			ContagionMimic: Sometimes, when a Mimic falls ill, instead of recovering fully, they turn into this monster. They can be birthed from ordinary chests by force.
			ContaminatedGhoul: Ghouls plagued by the Contagion slobber infectious drool that weakens their victim's immune system.
			Cougher: Coughers fly around seeking prey to coat in their poisonous breath, Their breath contains a pathogen able to completely destroy their target's immune system making it easier for the contagion to infect.
			EctoHand: They reach out, as if to touch their lost life. Or maybe they just want to give you a high-five?
			Gargoyle: Made of stone, they resemble mythical creatures. They guard the Hellcastle and its treasures.
			GreenPigron: This elusive dragon-pig hybrid has excellent stealth capabilities despite its rotund figure. It is uncertain how they came to exist.
			HellboundLizard: Similar in appearance to Lihzahrds, they run about in the Hellcastle, seemingly without purpose.
			Ickslime: Gelatinous and icky sentient globs of mucus, Ickslimes break down their prey into material for the contagion to make new monsters.
			ViralMummy: With the sands transmogrified by outside forces, those put to rest in the desert, whether good or evil, now rise to maim and kill.
			Viriling: Unfinished creatures of the Contagion, intelligent enough to avenge their parent from day one of their existence.
			Viris: Giant breeders of the plague, Virises use Ickslimes' materials to create new spawn to help spread the Contagion.
			Bactus: Spawned from the Contagion as a carrier of disease, it desires nothing more than to see the world rot.
			BloodshotEye: The bloodiest of eyes, this creature exists in a state of fear. Its veins may rupture at any time.
			BoneFish: This skeleton of a fish pesters anyone who enters the lava in the Underworld. Be careful if you ever need to explore under the lava's surface.
			FallenHero: A hero, fallen into blood. It roams aimlessly on nights of a Blood Moon.
			Pyrasite: Giant flat worms created by the Contagion, these creatures enjoy feeding on pre-eaten food from the stomach of titans and other large lifeforms.
			BacteriumPrime: This giant eye of Contagion never ceases, never truly closes. Those who fall to its gaze will be just as felled by its plague.
			DesertBeak: The guardian of the desert, this large vulture summons its smaller brethren to assist it in battle. It lifts prey up with its talons, then drops them to fall to their doom.
			IrateBones: These Angry Bones have donned a set of armor to further fuel their wrath.
			CursedScepter: Enchanted through the malevolence of the Dungeon, weapons like this cut intruders down to size.
			CursedFlamer: Cousins of the Corruptor, these malevolent creatures shoot cursed flames at anyone who dares to intrude into the Corruption.
			Hallowor: A guardian of light, this being spits a substance that purifies the world.
			ContaminatedGoldfish: Goldfish mutate and become violent when exposed to a Blood Moon, allowing the Contagion to take hold of them.
			ContaminatedPenguin: During a Blood Moon, the normally docile penguins fall under the hostile influence of the Contagion.
			ContaminatedBunny: Bunnies are pure beings that normally cannot be afflicted by the Contagion, but will succumb under the effects of a Blood Moon.
			Shadlopod: These devious creatures blend themselves into the ebonstone ceilings of the corruption and take pleasure in watching their prey panic when they take their vision away.
